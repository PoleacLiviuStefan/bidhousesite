          The apartments to be purchased under the project will be offered for rent for three periods of time depending on demand and area: long, medium and short term rental.<br />

Long-term, apartments will be rented to families for a minimum of 1-2 years to ensure financial security for investors and NFT buyers.<br/>

Medium term. They will be rented for 2-7 days through companies like Airbnb, Booking, etc. Here the value of profits and gains for the landlords will be higher and the profit is to be determined.<br />

Short term rental will be available to video chatters and podcasters. In designing the apartment we will be using an interior designer to ensure professionalism. <br />

The apartments will be rented 24 hours a day, the rest of the time they will be undergoing cleaning and maintenance. The rental price for this period of the apartments will start from $100 per day. We will also make available photographers, video editors and sound engineers to create the necessary content at a higher quality, this will all be available at at an extra cost. The  profits of these services will be shared amongst the NFT holders.
