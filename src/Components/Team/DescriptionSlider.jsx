        <Description namembr="BUJOREA CRISTIAN & BUJOREA DANIEL" descriptiontxt="Who are Bujorea brothers and why they start this ambitious project?

We start Bidhouse simply out of passion. We saw the technology behind the NFTs and realized its  potential and room
to become mass adopted by every single business. We wanted to become pioneers for this new business model and build
a real business around it.
We worked in business development and optimization from 2008, we had and have different companies with different activities,
that shape for us different skills. This skills are advantageous here, especially when there was no line to follow, any sort of
traditional model. I saw an open market and a chance to actually interconnect investors/web3 with traditional business.

How this looks on paper is by us viewing the NFT's as stock/shares, the holders being treated as investors, being transparent with
ourcash balance sheets and overall finances, and simply reinvesting every single penny we make.	"/>

We have developed teams of leaders in different fields. I graduated from the Faculty of Law at the State University of Craiova. I always dreamed big and I liked to become a person who can help other people, I still do that. I have a life experience of 35 years, until now.  I'm married. At the moment I coordinate teams of entrepreneurs and am an investor in several fields of the future. What about the project, I can only say that I love this project from the bottom of my heart and I am very sure that it will only be successful. Why do I say this for sure, even if it depends on several aspects?  The answer is simple, because I met two brothers and especially one of them, Cristian in this case, with whom I resonated from the first meeting and it was as if we had known each other for a lifetime.
Tne  same vision, goal but also love of people, the burning desire to help and be successful, until I validated that we are definitely on the same path, a good one.
I can tell you about the team that they are dedicated people, with extraordinary professional and human qualities.
This is how I can describe in a few words what we are, what we want, what we do and where we will all end up together, only through work and dedication.

Together we succeed!	"/>

What about this new NFT current, I started working on national but also international projects, a fact that taught me that no matter how promising the fact that you work internationally sounds, you still get along better with people from your country. The crypto world started to enter my life when I started to learn what NFTs are eaten with. I had started making a daily schedule, at least 3 hours in which I would read everything possible about these two great worlds that merged extraordinarily beautifully.
The BidHouse project, for me, is a manual on how to make an NFT project successful. The people behind this project are extremely devoted and ready for this project to exceed all expectations. It is an honor to represent this project as general artist of NFTs"/>

Besides these, I have been a plastic artist for over ten years and recently I also entered the field of NFTs, thus developing my personal project based on art and architecture.
Over time I participated in countless national and international art and architecture competitions. I managed to get good results, giving me the chance to improve professionally in Berlin through Erasmus. Through the acquired skills and experience accumulated in residential interior/exterior design projects of collective and semi-collective blocks, hotels, single-family houses and guesthouses, I intend to take this project to another architectural level through the crypto-residential development of the Bidhouse project.
it's a new challenge for me to take a crypto project to another level through visual art and for this reason I thought it was interesting to join forces with all of us from different fields and make a crypto hype project
For me, Bidhouse means a major start for the realization of the first Crypto headquarters in Romania, which I will have to develop through art, technique and then the realization of the architectural and functional concept.
I am eager for new challenges like this and the development of the apartments that will come to our community, through their transformation at the design level and their cinematic promotion.
Bidhouse is the future in crypto real estate developments and deserves to be full of prosperity and valuable members from all fields."/>
